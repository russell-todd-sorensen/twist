<div class="title">tWSDL: Current Standards for Web Services</div>
<div class="abstract">
 Interoperability of Web Services demands standardization. There are many
 applicable standards in this area. These are outlined below.
</div>

<div class="cat">
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl.html">WSDL 1.1: Web Services Description Language</a>
<div class="body">
 The abstract of WSDL 1.1 reads as follows:
 <q class="quote">
 WSDL is an XML format for describing network services as a set of endpoints
 operating on messages containing either document-oriented or procedure-oriented
 information. The operations and messages are described abstractly, and then
 bound to a concrete network protocol and message format to define an endpoint.
 Related concrete endpoints are combined into abstract endpoints (services). WSDL
 is extensible to allow description of endpoints and their messages regardless of
 what message formats or network protocols are used to communicate, however, the
 only bindings described in this document describe how to use WSDL in conjunction
 with SOAP 1.1, HTTP GET/POST, and MIME.
 </q>
 Note that our tWSDL application will focus on document-oriented information represented 
 in XML 1.0 using a SOAP 1.1 envelope and transported via HTTP POST.

<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/">XML 1.0</a>
| <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/">XML Schema Structures</a>
| <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/">XML Schema Datatypes</a>
<div class="body">
XML 1.0 with XML Schema will be used to represent all WSDL documents and all messages
exchanged between client and server applications. These standards have the following overall 
goals:
 <q class="quote" title="XML 1.0 Abstract">
 The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a subset of SGML that is completely described
 in this document. Its goal is to enable generic SGML to be served, received, and
 processed on the Web in the way that is now possible with HTML. XML has been designed
 for ease of implementation and for interoperability with both SGML and HTML.
 </q>
 <q class="quote" title="XML Schema: Structures Abstract">
 XML Schema: Structures specifies the XML Schema definition language, which offers
 facilities for describing the structure and constraining the contents of XML 1.0 documents,
 including those which exploit the XML Namespace facility. The schema language, which is
 itself represented in XML 1.0 and uses namespaces, substantially reconstructs and considerably
 extends the capabilities found in XML 1.0 document type definitions (DTDs). This specification
 depends on XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes.
 </q>
 <q class="quote" title="XML Schema: Datatypes Abstract">
 XML Schema: Datatypes is part 2 of the specification of the XML Schema language. It defines
 facilities for defining datatypes to be used in XML Schemas as well as other XML
 specifications. The datatype language, which is itself represented in XML 1.0, provides a
 superset of the capabilities found in XML 1.0 document type definitions (DTDs) for specifying
 datatypes on elements and attributes.

<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap11/">SOAP 1.1: Simple Object Access Protocol</a>
<div class="body">
 SOAP 1.1 transport bindings with HTTP will be used.
 <q class="quote" title="SOAP 1.1 Abstract">
 SOAP is a lightweight protocol for exchange of information in a decentralized, distributed
 environment. It is an XML based protocol that consists of three parts: an envelope that defines
 a framework for describing what is in a message and how to process it, a set of encoding rules
 for expressing instances of application-defined datatypes, and a convention for representing
 remote procedure calls and responses. SOAP can potentially be used in combination with a variety
 of other protocols; however, the only bindings defined in this document describe how to use SOAP
 in combination with HTTP and HTTP Extension Framework.
 </q>
 Note that we will not (initially) be using the remote procedure call type of interaction or SOAP encoding.

<a href="http://www.ws-i.org/Profiles/BasicProfile-1.0-2004-04-16.html">WS-I: Basic Profile</a>
<div class="body">
 WS-I is a set of considerations which promote interoperability between unrelated clients and 
 servers of web services. Since web services are based upon the many standards listed above,
 it is essential to define a limitation. The guiding principles of WS-I Basic Profile are as
 follows:
 <q class="quote" title="WS-I Basic Profile Guiding Principles">
 <p>The Profile was developed according to a set of principles that, together, 
 form the philosophy of the Profile, as it relates to bringing about interoperability. This section
 documents these guidelines.</p>
 <dl>
  <dt>No guarantee of interoperability</dt>
  <dd>It is impossible to completely guarantee the interoperability of a particular service. However,
      the Profile does address the most common problems that implementation experience has
      revealed to date.</dd>
  <dt>Application semantics</dt>
  <dd>Although communication of application semantics can be facilitated by the technologies that 
      comprise the Profile, assuring the common understanding of those semantics is not
      addressed by it.</dd>
   <dt>Testability</dt>
   <dd>When possible, the Profile makes statements that are testable. However, 
      such testability is not required. Preferably, 
     testing is achieved in a non-intrusive manner (e.g., examining artifacts "on the wire"). 
     </dd>
   <dt>Strength of requirements</dt>
   <dd>The Profile makes strong requirements (e.g., MUST, MUST NOT) wherever 
     feasible; if there are legitimate cases where such a requirement cannot be met, 
     conditional requirements (e.g., SHOULD, SHOULD NOT) are used. Optional and conditional 
     requirements introduce ambiguity and mismatches between 
     implementations.</dd>
   <dt>Restriction vs. relaxation</dt>
   <dd>When amplifying the requirements of referenced specifications, the Profile may 
     restrict them, but does not relax them (e.g., change a MUST to a MAY). 
     </dd>

   <dt>Multiple mechanisms</dt>
   <dd>If a referenced specification allows multiple mechanisms to be used interchangeably, 
     the Profile selects those that are well-understood, widely implemented and useful. 
     Extraneous or underspecified mechanisms and extensions introduce complexity and 
     therefore reduce interoperability.</dd>
   <dt>Future compatibility</dt>
   <dd>When possible, the Profile aligns its requirements with in-progress revisions 
      to the specifications it references (e.g., SOAP 1.2, WSDL 1.2). This aids implementers 
     by enabling a graceful transition, and assures that WS-I does not 'fork' from these efforts. 
     When the Profile cannot 
     address an issue in a specification it references, this information is communicated to the
     appropriate body to assure its consideration.</dd>
   <dt>Compatibility with deployed services</dt>
   <dd>Backwards compatibility with deployed Web services is not a 
     goal for the Profile, but due consideration is given to it; the Profile does not introduce
     a change to the requirements of a referenced specification unless doing so addresses 
     specific interoperability issues.</dd>

   <dt>Focus on interoperability</dt>
   <dd>Although there are potentially a number of inconsistencies and design flaws 
     in the referenced specifications, the Profile only addresses those that affect 
     interoperability.</dd>
   <dt>Conformance targets</dt>
   <dd>Where possible, the Profile places requirements on artifacts (e.g., WSDL 
     descriptions, SOAP messages) rather than the producing or consuming software's behaviors 
     or roles. Artifacts are concrete, making them easier to verify and therefore making 
     conformance easier to understand and less error-prone.</dd>
   <dt>Lower-layer interoperability</dt>
   <dd>The Profile speaks to interoperability at the application layer; it assumes that
      interoperability of lower-layer protocols (e.g., TCP, IP, Ethernet) is adequate and 
      well-understood. Similarly, statements about application-layer substrate protocols 
      (e.g., SSL/TLS, HTTP) are only made when there is an issue affecting Web services 
      specifically; WS-I does not attempt to assure the interoperability of these protocols 
      as a whole. This assures that WS-I's expertise in and focus on Web services 
      standards is used effectively.</dd>

<div class="body">May be used as a model for maintaining data in Tcl. The XML Infoset is an in memory
 representation of a number of (but not all) facts about an XML document. The missing facts do not affect
 the semantic meaning of the document, although they may affect the serialized representation. For
 instance, an XML Infoset only contains the normalized text value of a node. Also an Infoset does
 not specify whether a node should be represented in a diminished form or as an empty element.
