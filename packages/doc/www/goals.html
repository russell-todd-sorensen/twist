 <div class="title">tWSDL Plan: Goals</div>
<div class="abstract">
    <p>Web Services have emerged as an important method of interaction
    between computer services. In the distant past such interactions were
    limited to large corporations by the high cost of implimenting EDI.
    The development of XML then SOAP allowed for easier access to legacy
    systems, something called 'loose coupling'. The early systems are 
    characterized as essentially procedures wrapped for transport in XML,
    and development efforts were focused upon methods of automatically
    wrapping existing API calls and exposing them to clients across a 
    network.</p?
    <p>The most recent advances have moved beyond this initial idea. 
    Most likely this move was initiated by changes to XML itself. XML has
    developed a very sophisticated typing system known as XML Schema. The
    terminology is analogous to the term in the field of SQL database. Using
    XML Schema Language, developers can create something know as a complex type.
    Additionally XML was extended to allow namespaces, an important development
    for combining elements and types from various sources.
    </p>
    <p>Web Services Description Language is dependent completely upon the useage of
    XML Schema. The WSDL file itself is defined through the use of XML Schema. The
    types of each message are also types defined by using XML Schema. WSDL does not
    require the messages themselves to be transmitted as XML, however XML Schema is
    a well constructed system for building types and therefore can form a useful 
    format for message typing, construction, exchange and validation.
    </p>

<div class="cat" >Goal 1: Well Typed Interactions Between Client and Server
 <div class="body">
  For successful client/server interaction, both parties must know how to construct
  valid messages. A message is more than a list of parameters. In fact, our target
  WSDL payload will be an XML document. These message documents have well defined types.
  The first activity in building a service is to list the types of messages which will
  be exchanged. tWSDL should provide methods to quickly define types and associate these
  types with messages. 

 </div>
</div>
<div class="cat" >Goal 2: Construction of valid WSDL Files and Messages. 
 <div class="body">Given a collection of message types and a few other pieces of information
 it should be possible to write a valid WSDL file defining the service in all particulars.
 


 </div>
</div>
<div class="cat" >Goal 3: Exchange of Request and Response Messages.
 <div class="body">A &nbsp; specific WSDL file defines how client and server interact
 over a network to exchange messages. The tWSDL package should handle the details
 of this exchange with minimum input from the client. Clients should only be required
 to know the published location of the WSDL describing the service to genereate a useful
 client API. Client should only be required to call API procedures with the minimum data 
 needed to construct the client message and process the server response. 


 </div>
</div>

<div class="cat" >Goal 4: Document Level Validation. 
 <div class="body">Document level validation provides the most immediate and 
 comprehensive feedback possible to both the client and server. 


 </div>
</div>

<div class="cat" >Goal 5: Maximal Error Detection and Reporting. 
 <div class="body">The validation system can only guarantee that messages fit
 the general datatype. It is possible that backend systems, such as a RDB will have
 uniqueness or other constraints which cannot be checked prior to an attempt to 
 invoke the service. However, it should be possible to check that each document, as
 received is correct according to the defined type. In the event that there is an
 error, the system should be able to report with specific details which will allow
 the server or client to determine the location of problem. In XML Schema there are
 simple types and complex types. Simple types are used to describe atomic values 
 such as an integer, a string, a boolean. Complex types are composed in various ways 
 from simple types. Error message should be able to identify the exact type which 
 was in error, the test which failed and possibly the incorrect value or other
 information.
