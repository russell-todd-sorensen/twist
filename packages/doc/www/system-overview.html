<div class="sidebar" title="Graphic Model Explanation">
 <p>
 The above figure illustrates the relationship between various components
 which will make up the tWSDL System. A graphic is hardly a model of a
 software application, but we can use it as a partial representation, which
 can be used as a reminder of how the system will work. Before going into an
 explaination of the parts, let me explain how the graphic represents the 
 relationship between the parts.
 </p>
 <p>Overall, the figure has three parts along a horizontal line. The parts are
 the client component, an undefined gap and the server component. The undefined
 gap merely represents a separation of the client and server. In our specific case
 this will usually be the internet or some other local network. Beyond the figure
 on the right and left are user requirements. Users setup servers and use clients. 
 Users can be people or other applications. The horizontal line (direction) also
 represents the layers of programs and applications between users. Therefore, each
 vertical line (the vertical sides of the boxes) represent an interface between 
 layers. This is usually refered to as an Application Programming Interface or API.
 </p>
 <p>Each box represents either a program or data, or both. The central gap is a
 data box which can be thought of as TCP packets or as HTTP requests and responses.
 Each vertical line also represents a barrier or boundary between programs and/or
 data.  
 </p>
 <p>Just as each vertical line divides applications or programs which have different
 functionality, each horizontal line divides parts of a system which offer similar
 functionality. An horizontal line also represent a division between an application and 
 the data it uses. 
 </p>
 <p>Each pair of horizontal line divides an overall system into channels. These channels
 work or exist to extend or expose the overall functionality of the system, end to end.
 </p>
 <p>Applying these generalities to the figure, notice that the tWSDL Core API & tWSDL DB
 is represented as a box which extends horizontally from the network interface to
 the user interface. This implies that this component mediates the entire process and
 calls on other components to perform various functions. The fact that it touches the 
 network interface reflects the fact that the Core component will provide an interface
 into the tWSDL DB database to serve WSDL files and other Web Service details. </p>
 <p>If you mouse over this component, a dashed red line will replace the solid base
 of the box. This indicates that information and/or control passes between the 
 components. However, the sides of the boxes remain solid, which indicates that 
 information/control MUST pass through the Core and not horizontally between components.
 So a red dashed line between components represents the way in which information/control
 flows.
 </p> 
</div>
 <p>The tWSDL Server is an application which will run on top of an instance
 of AOLserver. AOLserver has a built in Tcl interpreter and an associated
 Tcl API. In addition, AOLserver allows installation of additional C and
 Tcl Modules. C Modules are accessed via an associated Tcl API. All
 exposed Tcl API are available to the tWSDL System.
 </p>
 <p>
 The tWSDL System is composed of several components. There will be a Core
 tWSDL API which will be used to maintain and manage all aspects of the 
 System. This Core API will be extensible in several areas for various 
 reasons.
 </p>
 <p>One extension area will be the Wrapper. A Core set of API will allow
 the developer to wrap any generic function. Extensions of this basic API
 will make it easier to create Wrappers for specific Tcl API for which 
 some otherwise necessary information can be derived. For example, a simple
 Wrapper could assume that all inputs and outputs are strings. Simple
 introspection would allow for inputs to be named. Another example could
 be for database procedures where the types can be looked up in a data
 dictionary. The Wrapper creates a function which takes a representation of
 an XML document and returns another XML document. The Wrapper is run once
 to create a tWSDL application. The API generated by the Wrapper will not
 be a localized API. It should be possible to package and move to another
 system without the need to rerun the Wrapper. One additional note on Wrapper
 extensions: it is also possible that an entirely different Wrapper can be
 used. The only requirement on the Wrapper is that it create a procedure
 which takes an XML document of the correct type and returns another XML 
 document of the correct type. In practice, these XML documents (their 
 in memory representation) will be Tcl namespace references.
 
 </p>
 <p>The Typer is another potential area for extension. The Core API will
 cover the allowable methods of creating types. A similar line of reasoning
 for Wrapper extensions can be applied to the Typer. In both cases, extensions
 will either make an assumption which limits the amount of data needed, or
 will be able to find the data needed from another source. 
 </p>
 <p>Following WS-I Basic Profile, tWSDL will only support SOAP over HTTP.
 However, it should be possible to add additional protocols as an extension.
 </p>
 <p>Several components will be relatively fixed. These will be the Invoker,
 the Type Checker and the Protocol Checker. Each of these components will
 operate under the direction of the tWSDL Core.</p>

<div class="cat" ><a name="application">A tWSDL Application 
 <div class="body"><p>
 Before going into more
 details about the Server in operation, let's note a few points about how
 a tWSDL Application will come to life.</p>
 </p>
 <p>Using the Core tWSDL API, a developer will write a script which will
 define the Application. This script should handle the generation of the 
 desired tWSDL Application. A generated tWSDL Application will consist of
 several parts:
 <ul>
  <li>A WSDL File: A Web Sevice Description defines the public interface
  of the Web Service. In the case of tWSDL, this file should contain ALL
  the information needed to use the service. </li>
  <li>A WRAP API: This consists of a series of API which will be called
  by the Invoker to perform the Service.</li>
  <li>New Types: Any types defined in the script will be added to the tWSDL
  DB. The tWSDL DB will be a collection of all data needed to run all
  tWSDL Applications in a particular AOLserver installation. On paper the
  tWSDL DB will just be a series of scripts which load data into memory.
  The in memory representation will be Tcl Namespaces (without procedures).
  </li>
  <li>New Registered Procs (Bindings): A startup file for the Application
  will use registered procs to 'bind' a service to the required address/port
  during server startup. The registered procs will invoke the tWSDL Core
  to handle the request.</li> 
  <li>Once the Service is loaded, a browsable copy of the WSDL Service 
  Description and SOAP Message examples will be published. </li>

 </ul>
