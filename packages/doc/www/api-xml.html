<div class="title">tWSDL: XML API</div>
<div class="abstract">All data exchanged in tWSDL is either in the
 form of a serialized XML Document or is an internal representation 
 of an XML Document. This section outlines a number of possibilities
 for handling XML Documents, for representing them internally and the
 API for producting them or converting from one form to another.
</div>
 

<div class="cat">XML Parser/XSLT: tDOM
 <div class="body">Currently tWSDL will have an external dependency
  on <a href="http://www.tdom.org/">tDOM</a> to parse a serialized XML Document
  into a Tcl list. This process will guarantee that the Document was well formed, 
  but will not check the validity of the document. tDOM is a very fast
  XML Parser written in C with a Tcl API. In addition to XML parsing, tDOM
  has a usable XSLT engine which can be used to process XML Documents. One
  use for XSLT might be to create a tWSDL Client API based upon the service
  WSDL file.
 </div>
</div>


<div class="cat">Internal XML Representation: Tcl Namespace
 <div class="body">
 <p>Although tDOM has excellent parsing capabilities, the 
 internal representation of XML Nodes is hidden in C language structures. 
 Additionally, accessing these structures creates commands which pollute
 the global namespace. The XML Standard itself recommends something called
 an XML Infoset. As the name implies, this is a data structure, so that everything
 should be accessible as a named variable, instead of as an object.method.
 </p>
 <p>Tcl has something called a Namespace which allows developers to organize data
 and commands into a hierarchical structure similar to an XML Document. The limitations
 on possible XML Element and Attribute names makes it easy to guarantee
 that any XML Document can be represented as a hierarchical Tcl Namespace.
 </p>
 </div>
</div>


<div class="cat">tDOM Tcl List to Tcl Namespace API
 <div class="body">One or more API can be used to convert a tDOM Tcl List which
 represents an XML Document or Fragment to a Tcl Namespace structure. A bare bones
 API would simply include the data obtained from tDOM, whereas a more complete
 API would add additional metadata as outlined by the 
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/">XML Infoset</a> recommendation.
 <pre class="code-example" title="Tcl List to Tcl Namespace API">
# API Signature: (this is a recursive procedure)
::wsdl::instance::new instanceNS xmlList {isDoc 0}

# For isntance:
::wsdl::instance::new ::mytns {addressBook {} {
 {card {type simple} {
  {name {type full} {{#text {John Smith}}}} {
  email {} {{#text js@example.com}}}}} {
 card {} {{name {} {{#text {Fred Bloggs}}}} {
  email {} {{#text fb@example.net}}}}}}} 1

# This corresponds to the XML Document:
&lt;!DOCTYPE addressBook SYSTEM "simple.dtd">
&lt;addressBook>
  &lt;card type="simple">
    &lt;name type="full">John Smith&lt;/name>
    &lt;email>js@example.com&lt;/email>
  &lt;/card>
  &lt;card>
    &lt;name>Fred Bloggs&lt;/name>
    &lt;email>fb@example.net&lt;/email>
  &lt;/card>
&lt;/addressBook>
 </pre>
 </div>
</div>

<div class="cat">Tcl Namespace to XML API
 <div class="body">Documents will be stored using one of several possible Tcl Namespace
 representations. When a document needs to be serialized, a corresponding API can translate
 this into XML. Here is an example of what a document fragment would look like as 
 a Tcl Namespace, and how it would serialize to XML.
 <pre class="code-example" title="Tcl Namespace Representation of XML Fragment">
namespace eval ::wsdl::instance::x::a:addresses {

    set .PARTS {address::0 address::1 notes owner}

    # Address is array, so dummy:
    namespace eval address {}

    namespace eval address::0 {
	set .ATTR(name) address1
	set .ATTR(location) home

	namespace eval street {
	    set .PARTS {.TEXT(0)}
	    set .TEXT(0) "3812 155th Ave. SE"
	}
	namespace eval city {
	    set .PARTS {.TEXT(0)}
	    set .TEXT(0) "Bellevue"
	}
	namespace eval state {
	    set .PARTS {.TEXT(0)}
	    set .TEXT(0) "WA"
	}
	namespace eval zip {
	    set .PARTS {.TEXT(0)}
	    set .TEXT(0) "98006"
	}

	set .PARTS {street city state zip}

    }
    namespace eval address::1 {
	set .ATTR(name) address2
	set .ATTR(location) work

	namespace eval street {
	    set .PARTS {.TEXT(0)}
	    set .TEXT(0) "4321 1st Ave. N"
	}
	namespace eval city {
	    set .PARTS {.TEXT(0)}
	    set .TEXT(0) "Seattle"
	}
	namespace eval state {
	    set .PARTS {.TEXT(0)}
	    set .TEXT(0) "WA"
	}
	namespace eval zip {
	    set .PARTS {.TEXT(0)}
	    set .TEXT(0) "98102"
	}

	set .PARTS {street city state zip}

    }

    namespace eval notes {
	set .PARTS {.TEXT(0) b .TEXT(1)}
	set .TEXT(0) "
   This is a "
	set .TEXT(1) " idea    
"
	namespace eval b {
	    set .PARTS {.TEXT(0)}
	    set .TEXT(0) Great
	}
    }
    namespace eval owner {
	set .PARTS {}
	set .ATTR(name) "Tom Jackson"
    }
}

 </pre>
 <p>Note that there are many ways to build up the above representation,
 the one shown being very verbose. The serializing API would be called like
 this:</p>
 <pre class="code-example" title="Serialized XML API"> 

 ::wsdl::instance::toXML ::wsdl::instance::x::a:addresses

 </pre>
 <p>Producing the following XML:</p>
 <pre class="code-example" title="Serialized XML of Tcl Namespace">

&lt;a:addresses>
 &lt;address location="home" name="address1">
  &lt;street>3812 155th Ave. SE&lt;/street>
  &lt;city>Bellevue&lt;/city>
  &lt;state>WA&lt;/state>
  &lt;zip>98006&lt;/zip>
 &lt;/address>
 &lt;address location="work" name="address2">
  &lt;street>4321 1st Ave. N&lt;/street>
  &lt;city>Seattle&lt;/city>
  &lt;state>WA&lt;/state>
  &lt;zip>98102&lt;/zip>
 &lt;/address>
 &lt;notes>
   This is a &lt;b>Great&lt;/b> idea    
 &lt;/notes>
 &lt;owner name="Tom Jackson"/>
&lt;/a:addresses>


 </pre>
 <p>The <span class="code">::wsdl::instance::toXML</span> API highlights the
 simplicity of passing a complex data structure when it is packaged as a Tcl Namespace.
 This simplicity will be exploited throughout the tWSDL Package. The Tcl Namespace
 representation relies on the fact that no XML Element may start with a punctuation
 mark, in this case a dot ".". Also notice that multiple elements of the same name are
 represented something like an array.</p>
