<div class="abstract">
    <p>Before embarking on a new software project it is important to 
    consider prior projects covering the same or similar functionality.
    The immediate ancestor of Web Services is SOAP. Within WSDL, SOAP is 
    considered as a wrapper and transport; therefore WSDL is much broader than a 
    software package which provides SOAP services.  </p>

    <p>Most software projects which are more than a year old (prior to March 2005),
    are extensions of SOAP projects. In particular they are extensions of SOAP-RPC.

<div class="body">
 Packages with a Tcl API are most revelant to the current project. Analysis of such projects
 has the potential to reveal strengths and limitations in Tcl as a language and in the community of
 programmers and users of Tcl software. Without singling out a particular package from those listed
 in the above link, several broad observations can be noted:
 <div class="quote">
  <div class="point">
      Both Tcl and AOLserver have support for UTF-8 and both are easy to extend in
      functionality using both Tcl scripting and procedures written in C (for speed
      or as a wrapper for an available library). Both Tcl and AOLserver have well 
      tested support for threads, and AOLserver offers advanced application server
      functionality.</div>
  <div class="point">
      Tcl is a weakly typed language. By that I mean that data elements are stored as strings
      until it is necessary for the data to be used in a particular format. Although
      Tcl provides introspection as to procedure names and definitions and variable names
      and values, it is impossible to derive type information for either inputs or outputs.
      It is possible via introspection to get the name of Tcl procedure parameters and their
      default values.</div>
  <div class="point">
      Prior Tcl packages have focused mostly on either client or server. Little work has gone into
      providing a solution for both ends of a conversation.  
  </div>
  <div class="point">
      Prior Tcl packages have focused on SOAP-RPC style interactions. This type of service is 
      characterized by a client supplying one or more inputs as a list of named elements, and 
      receiving back from the server one or more outputs as a list of named elements. The type 
      of interaction is essentially identical to a procedure call in Tcl, although procedure
      calls in Tcl are positional.
  </div>
  <div class="point">
      All prior Tcl packages have used either tDOM or tclDOM to process incoming XML fragments or
      documents. Some have used these packages to build up an XML document and to serialize
      the finished document. tDOM appears to be the most stable and thread friendly package.
      Neither tDOM nor tclDOM can validate a document using XML Schema. I have not investigated
      the extent of DTD validation.
  </div>
  <div class="point">
      None of the available  Tcl packages have implimented validation of either outgoing
      or incoming documents or element values. Some packages have partially addressed validation
      of elements, but in most cases errors are not caught until some point far removed from the
      web service layer.
  </div>
  <div class="point">
      None of the available Tcl packages are able to understand or process a WSDL file.
  </div>
  <div class="point">
      OpenACS projects have additional un-necessary overhead (layers) making it impossible to 
      utilize their functionality without installing OpenACS, or alternatively making it
      timeconsuming to extract the functionality from these projects.

 <div class="body">
 Simple Web Services API is an initiative by Active State to create a cross programming language API for
 handling web services. Probably the most important points with regard to this initiative is that currently
 there is no Tcl API, and secondly, it doesn't handle complex types.

 <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/java/user-guide.html#Introduction">Apache Axis</a>
<div class="body">What is Axis?
 <q class="quote" title="From Introduction to Axis"> Axis is essentially a <i>SOAP engine</i> -- a framework for constructing SOAP processors
 such as clients, servers, gateways, etc. The current version of Axis is written in Java, but a
 C++ implementation of the client side of Axis is being developed.


<p>But Axis isn't just a SOAP engine -- it also includes:</p>


<ul>
  
<li>a simple stand-alone server,</li>
  
<li>a server which plugs into servlet engines such as Tomcat,</li>
  
<li>extensive support for the <i>Web Service Description Language (WSDL)</i>,</li>

  
<li>emitter tooling that generates Java classes from WSDL.</li>
  
<li>some sample programs, and</li>
  
<li>a tool for monitoring TCP/IP packets.</li>

</ul>

  Axis is the third generation of Apache SOAP
 </q>

  <p>So Apache Axis is mostly a SOAP Engine. I looked at Apache Axis to see
  if there was any functionality that we could offload, or to use as a library in tWSDL. 
  Since tWSDL has a component architecture, there are any number of ways that this could
  be possible. For instance, a Tcl interface could just hand off everything to an Axis Server.
  </p>
  <p>However, a good read through the 
  <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/java/user-guide.html#Introduction">Introduction to Apache Axis</a>
  leads to the opposite conclusion: tWSDL may end up being a good way to interface a
  Java application (or any application running on the server) via WSDL!</p>
  <p>Why? Apache Axis fails in a number of important respects:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Axis is almost entirely focused on RPC style, or uses a wrapped document encoding.</li>
   <li>Axis maps Java types to XML Schema types using a best guess methodology. For instance
   base64 encoding is mapped to a byte array, even though there are only 64 valid bytes in
   base64. Another minor point, you should map XML Schema types to Java types, since the 
   description language uses XML Schema.
   <li>Axis provides Zero Type Checking! This means you get zero specificity when an error
   occurs.</li>
   <li>Axis requires too much knowledge of WSDL and SOAP, and these details should be mostly
   transparent to the developer.</li>
   <li>Axis (or the developers of Axis) are confused about what a WSDL Binding represents.
   That confusion is that the binding (in this case SOAP) is the most
   important part of WSDL. </li>
  </ul>

</div>

<div class="abstract">
  <p>WSDL moves far beyond SOAP by defining an abstract, language neutral interface to
  an application. This definition allows for type definition and type checking prior to
  application invocation. In addition, this new functionality reduces the complexity of
  the protocol to which it is bound. The protocol can now deal with transport issues and
  not with encoding details. On the client side, WSDL provides a short path to a functional
  set of API to interact with the WSDL Application, again providing features such as type
  checking, error handling, and of course message construction and transport. Client
  side programming will feel very much like a using a Database API.</p>
