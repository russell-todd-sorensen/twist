<div class="title">tWSDL: API Proposals</div>
<div class="abstract">The tWSDL API should take into account the overall
proposed structure outlined in the System Overview. Although the System
Overview does not show all details, roughly speaking each box, at a minimum,
will represent a distinct module, or namespace. An exact list of functions
cannot be arrived at at this stage of development, but certain general 
considerations can be established. The following discussion will trace the
steps a developer would take in using the tWSDL API to develop an application.

</div>

<div class="cat">Development of Types
 <div class="body">
 <p>I am finding it hard to overstress the importance of types
 in the WSDL framework. This is especially important to understand for 
 Tcl programmers who rarely have to deal with types until some bug shows up
 and forces the issue. But the same can be said of programmers in general. Many
 many bugs and corresponding developer time can be traced to feeding the
 wrong data to a function. A Web Service essentially allows a remote user to 
 invoke functions on a system with data of the user's choice. Even with the best
 of intentions, it is unwise to accept un-checked data from users.
 </p>
 <p>Fortunately WSDL demands the use of XML Schema to define types. At first, XML Schema
 appears to be difficult and complicated. In actual fact, it is rather easy to
 explain and use. In explaining it here, I will introduce the expected API for
 defining types.
 </p>
 </div>
 <div class="cat">Simple Types (simpleType)
 <div class="point">Every developer is familiar with simple types. From now on,
 I will refer to any XML Schema type that is simple as a simpleType. This will distinguish
 it from simple types in other languages. A simpleType is Atomic. Atomic means that a 
 simpleType cannot be decomposed any further. All XML Schema built in types are simpleTypes.
 </div>
 <div class="sidebar" title="XML Schema Built In Types">
  Examples of simpleTypes
  <ul>
   <li>string</li>
   <li>decimal</li>
   <li>dateTime</li>
   <li>integer</li>
  </ul>
 </div>
 <div class="point">
 XML Schema has an extensive number of 'built-in' types. These built-in types are
 also called 'primitive' types. The real meaning is that in order to completely 
 support XML Schema the software package must provide these built-in types so that
 all other simpleTypes can be constructed from them. An example of the API for 
 including primitive types is as follows:
 <pre class="code-example">

proc ::wsdl::types::newPrimitiveType {typeName code description} {

    namespace eval ::wsdl::tcl::$typeName [list variable description "$description"]

    proc ::wsdl::tcl::${typeName}::validate { value } $code
}
 
 </pre>
 <p>The top level namespace is <span class="code">::wsdl</span>. This may change,
 for instance maybe  <span class="code">::twsdl</span> would be better. Below that
 is the  <span class="code">::wsdl::tcl</span> namespace. I am temporarily using
 this namespace as an indication that the type checking are based upon tcl types, and are not
 yet exactly the same as the definition given by XML Schema. Once we have a complete list of
 primitive types that match XML Schema types, we can move the primitive namespace to something
 else. However, it will still be possible to create derived types based upon the Tcl types,
 they will still be primitive in tWSDL, but will require the client to be the tWSDL client. 
 </p>
 </div>
 <div class="point">It will often be the case that a simpleType will be identical to another
 type except by name. In this case, we need an API which creates the type and uses
 the built in validation for the original type:
 <pre class="code-example">

proc ::wsdl::types::addSimpleType {tns typeName {base "tcl::anySimpleType"} } {

    namespace eval ::wsdl::${tns}::${typeName} [list variable base "$base"]
    
    proc ::wsdl::${tns}::${typeName}::validate { value } "
       variable base
       if {\[::wsdl::\${base}::validate \$value]} { 
           return 1} else { return 0}"

} 
 </pre>
 <p>This API also demonstrates that types have namespaces. (Note that this is different than
 a Tcl namespace, although we will use the type namespace name as the name of the Tcl namespace
 for the type.)  The example API puts the type namespace as a child of the
 <span class="code">::wsdl</span> namespace. It might be necessary to create a separate toplevel
 for all types. 
 </p>
 <p>New simpleTypes can also be derived from other simpleTypes or primitive types. You derive
 a new simpleType by several means: one is by enumeration and the other is by pattern.
 <p>
 <p>Here are example calls of both API:
 <pre class="code-example">

::wsdl::types::restrictionByEnumeration::new "CreditCardTypeCode" "s:string" {

 "Visa"  "Mastercard"  "AmericanExpress"  "Discover"  "DinersClub" 

}

::wsdl::types::restrictionByPattern::new "guid" "s:string" \
 {[0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}}
 </pre>
