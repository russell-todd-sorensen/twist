# Really Primitive Types:
# Any Simple Type:
::wsdl::schema::new tcl "urn:tcl"

::wsdl::types::primitiveType::new tcl anySimpleType {return 1} {Base type, should return true for every case}
::wsdl::doc::document doc types tcl anySimpleType {Base type, should return true for every case}

# String type
::wsdl::types::primitiveType::new tcl string {return 1} {String type. Anything should pass as true}
::wsdl::doc::document doc types tcl string {String type. Anything should pass as true}


# NOTE: Tcl Types Will not be primitive types for very long
# Need to pick a namespace for primitive types.
# The namespace for tcl will likely be just 'tcl', or maybe 'tcl:tk' or 'urn:tcl:tk'.
# NOTE TO FUTURE DEVELOPERS: namespace refers to XML namespaces not Tcl namespaces,
# NOTE that XML namespaces have : separator, a legal char in a tcl namespace.
